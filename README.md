## Canonical Identity (Non-Negotiable)

**One-Line Truth**

NovaLIS is a deterministic household control-plane that executes user-initiated capabilities through a single Master Governor, with no autonomy, no background cognition, and full auditability.

**Constitutional Invariants**

- No autonomy (user → Nova → Governor → action → Nova → user)

- No background cognition or silent execution

- Deterministic behavior (same input → same output)

- Offline-first by default; online only by explicit request

- Explicit invocation only (no inferred intent)

- Full inspectability (logs, traces, ledgers, manifests)

If any code or proposal contradicts the above, it is **invalid by definition** unless an explicit governance unlock exists.

## Phase Status (Reality-Aligned)

| Phase | Status | Notes |

|------|-------|------|

| Phase 0–2 | ✅ **Frozen** | Constitutional foundation, deterministic core, governed actions |

| Phase 3 | ✅ **FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE & LOCKED** | Core behavior complete; Governor enforcement assumptions invalidated and corrected in Phase 3.5 |

| Phase 3.5 | 🔄 **Active** | Trust visibility, recovery tooling, interpretive awareness |

| Phase 4 | 🚫 **Blocked** | Governed agent execution (requires Phase 3.5 completion) |

| Phase 4.5 | 🛡️ **Locked & Inert** | Deep Think (structured analysis) |

| Phase 5–9 | 🧠 **Planned** | Optional, governance-bounded expansions |

| Phase 10+ | 🚫 **Forbidden** | Autonomy or self-initiated behavior |

**Important:**

Phase progression is enforced as a **hard safety barrier**, not a roadmap suggestion.

## What Exists in This Repository

This repository contains:

- A **FastAPI + WebSocket backend** implementing the NovaLIS brain

- A **deterministic skill registry** (system / weather / news)

- A **memory governance substrate** (design intent only; locked/active/deferred tiers require explicit governance unlock)

- A **static dashboard UI** (observer/control surface)

- **Governance contracts, locks, and acceptance gates**

- **Recovery and verification tooling**

Large runtime artifacts (models, binaries) are intentionally excluded from version control.

## What This Repository Does *Not* Do

NovaLIS explicitly does **not**:

- Act autonomously or proactively

- Perform background reasoning or monitoring

- Infer user intent

- Adapt behavior based on history or habits

- Execute actions without explicit invocation

- Enable governed agent execution (Phase 4 is blocked)

- Provide “helpful” escalation beyond defined contracts

If a feature requires Nova to **decide, assume, or initiate**, it is **illegal** under the current canon.

## Repository Navigation (Required for Review)

This repository must be reviewed using the deterministic order defined in:

➡ **REPO_MAP.md**

That document specifies:

- Canonical governance sources

- Safe review order for humans and AI

- Phase-sensitive files

- Explicit review constraints

Any review or change proposal that ignores REPO\_MAP.md is considered **unsafe**.

## Contribution Rules (Binding)

All contributions are governed by:

➡ **CONTRIBUTING.md**

Key rules include:

- No scope expansion without explicit unlock

- No refactors that risk behavioral drift

- No background tasks, telemetry, or adaptive behavior

- Smallest possible diffs

- Governance always overrides convenience

If you are unsure whether a change is allowed: **do not implement it**.

## Runtime Dependencies

Runtime dependencies such as STT models or media tools are **installed locally** and excluded from Git.

See:

- nova\_backend/tools/README.md

- .gitignore

This repository is intentionally **not self-contained** at runtime.

## Status Disclaimer

NovaLIS is **acceptance-gated** and **not production-complete**.

Claims of capability are valid **only** where explicitly implemented and verified.

Specification does not imply availability.
