# Current Priority

Current active task:

```text
Approval gate wiring — certified for current scope (2026-05-19).
```

Priority lock:

```text
docs/status/ACTIVE_PRIORITY_LOCK_2026-05-15_APPROVAL_GATE_WIRING.md
```

Closeout:

```text
docs/status/APPROVAL_GATE_CERTIFICATION_CLOSEOUT_2026-05-19.md
```

Status:

```text
Approval-gate certification is complete for the current
registry-confirmation-bound capability scope: Cap 22 and Cap 64.
Closeout recorded in APPROVAL_GATE_CERTIFICATION_CLOSEOUT_2026-05-19.md.
capability_locks.json intentionally not modified (separate P1-P5 process).
Trust Panel MVP receipt surface is complete and merged.
Website-preview live-backend validation remains follow-up debt.
```

Scope:

```text
certification closeout for registry-confirmation-bound scope only
no runtime behavior changes
no capability expansion
no authority expansion
capability_locks.json not modified
```

## Recent closed / not merged truth

```text
PR #151 — Everyday UX continuity sync closed unmerged.
PR #155 — Runtime docs regeneration closed unmerged.
```

Generated runtime docs are current as of the latest `python scripts/check_runtime_doc_drift.py` pass recorded on PR #185. No pending regeneration PR is needed unless that check fails again.

## Historical branch note

```text
audit/full-repo-doc-code-alignment
```

is historical/stale work. Do not reuse it as an active merge target.

## Current grounded repo summary

```text
Nova is a governance-first local AI/runtime platform with real bounded execution infrastructure, real OpenClaw runtime systems, real mediation layers, and active hardening against authority drift.

OpenClaw is implemented runtime code, not planning-only.

The PASS4 freeform-goal governance gap appears patched by PR #154 through a read-only allowlist, mutation-tool exclusion, MeteredNetworkProxy enforcement, explicit approve-action stub labeling, and regression tests.

This does not make OpenClaw broadly autonomous or fully certified.
```

## Phase Status Annotation (human layer)

`CURRENT_RUNTIME_STATE.md` is the authoritative machine-generated source. The following is
a human-layer interpretation annotation only:

```text
Phase 8 — PARTIAL. Broader envelope-governed execution remains deferred.
           CURRENT_RUNTIME_STATE.md lists this under Known Runtime Gaps.
Phase 9 — ACTIVE surfaces built on a partially incomplete Phase 8 foundation.
           Treat as IN PROGRESS until envelope execution is converged.
```

This does not override the generated runtime docs. It records the interpretation gap.

## Active / certified / locked discipline

```text
active != certified != locked
```

Current lock truth:

```text
Cap 16 — P1-P5 passed / locked.
Cap 64 — P1-P4 passed / P5 pending / approval-gate certified / not locked.
Cap 22 — approval-gate certified / P1-P5 pending in locks file / not locked.
Cap 65 — P1-P4 passed / P5 pending / not locked.
Most other active capabilities — certification lock phases pending.
```

## Open carried-forward follow-ups

```text
#141 — Search widget WebSocket surfacing fix and live proof complete; issue is closed.
#142 — RS-2 capability list truncation needs reproduction.
#143 — "tell me more" with prior context needs session-state-aware test.
```

#141 is no longer the active follow-up. The approval-gate lane is closed out.

## Next correct sequence

```text
1. Approval-gate certification closeout is complete for Cap 22 + Cap 64.
2. Per-capability P5/lock decisions remain separate and pending.
3. Next lanes: open follow-ups (#142, #143), five-pass roadmap items,
   or new reviewed priority lock for next workstream.
4. Do not reopen the approval-gate lane unless registry truth changes.
```

## Safety boundary

Do not start or include:

```text
runtime behavior changes
capability expansion
authority expansion
OpenClaw expansion
browser/computer-use expansion
external writes
Shopify writes
email sending
finance automation
social posting automation
ElevenLabs implementation
Google connector runtime implementation
UI simplification implementation
autonomous workflow execution
```

## Preserved boundary

```text
Intelligence is not authority.
```

This file is an agent continuity note. Runtime truth still comes from code and generated runtime docs.
